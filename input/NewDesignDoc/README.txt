In order to compile and execute the code run the following commands

1. g++ main.cpp
2. ./a.out inputfile.s latency.txt

Note :-
	
	replace inputfile.s with any file you have to check upon
	latency.txt represents the latency file

Our program run in 2 modes 
1. step by step mode
	shows the working of pipeline in step by step manner.

2. final mode
	shows the final values of all the registers and counters.
